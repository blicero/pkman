    I want to keep track of some things, most importantly /when/ updates are
    installed. Also, when packages are installed, deleted, etc. Eventually,
    I'd like to provide a nice interface to do something with that data.
    I'll probably end up using SQLite again. But that is not final.

    Among the various package managers I am familiar with, I most like the
    interfaces offered by zypper on openSuse and pkg on FreeBSD.
*** Operations [0/6]
    It would probably best to define which operations I want to expose.
    I will probably want to add more as I go along.
    - [ ] Update package repos
    - [ ] Search packages
    - [ ] Install packages
    - [ ] Remove packages
    - [ ] Install updates
    - [ ] List installed packages
    - [ ] Clean up
